# Predicting-House-Prices-with-Linear-Regression
This project builds a predictive model using linear regression to estimate a numerical outcome based on relevant features. The model is trained and evaluated using a dataset with numerical variables.

Key Steps:
Data Collection & Cleaning: Preprocessing the dataset, handling missing values, and ensuring data quality.
Feature Selection: Identifying important features that influence the target variable.
Model Training: Implementing linear regression using Scikit-Learn.
Model Evaluation: Assessing performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).
Visualization: Creating plots to compare actual vs. predicted values.
